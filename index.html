                <li>1. Do you think that information and communication technologies (ICTs) affect your behavior or other people’s behavior? And why (yes or no)?</li>
                <li>Yes, it makes me more concerned with how I appear online because it is harder to convey emotions and personality</li>
                <li>2. Do you think that ICTs increase or decrease your social interactions?
                    </li>
                    <li>Increase my social interactions with people in general but decrease my face to face interactions</li>
                <li>3. How often do you spend time with friends face-to-face? Do ICTs affect this?
                    I spend a good time with friends at sports and such, but also when I hang out with them outside of school but sometimes I spend more time on my phone than talking to them.

                <h3>Impact and Effects of Social Media</h3>
                <p>
                <li>Social networks have become the central facilitators for daily communication with peers, family, and acquaintances. Out of a survey by Carson Reider on Media Group containing over 800 people when asked about the effect of social media on friendships, 39% of the survey respondents reported feeling closer to their friends because of social media while 26% of the same sample felt they had more friends because of social media. While not all these relationships may be face to face many people believe social media has led to the era of virtual relationships, and people communicating differently. Without face to face interaction people’s candor has been  observed as having changed. With large platforms and comparatively low consequences, people are saying things they would not normally say in real life.

                    <h2>Social Media is Ruining Kids</h2>
                    <li>A recent Pew Research Center found that 92% of teens go online daily and that 24% say they are online "constantly." If you think they are on Facebook and you can follow their activities on the site, think again.</li>
                    <li>A survey of American teens reported that only 15% of kids say Facebook is their favorite social network. Thirty-three percent choose Instagram, 20% go to Twitter and 19% pick Snapchat, an app that allows them to post pictures -- including nude ones of themselves -- that disappear after view.</li>
                    <li>The advent of social technology may bear some responsibility for anxiety and depression in adolescents, teenagers and young adults. Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and Instagram -- they are all fun -- until things get out of hand. The facts are almost as depressing as the conditions themselves.</li>

                    <h3>Our Take</h3>
                    
                    <li>We as a collective group believe that social media with all of its adverse effects has become part of our community, and provides many benefits that when used correctly as a tool outnumber the consequences. </li>
                    <li>ICTs maybe take away from our face to face communication, but it allows us to be in constant contact with our friends, learn when we don't have a teacher, and stay in tune with the rest of the world so we can know what is happening on a global scale. </li>
                    <li>We have reached an age where everything is digital, and with proper use of social media and online education we believe that social media is a powerful tool that we should all have access to. </li>
