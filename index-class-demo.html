                <p><li>Water is a fundamental human need. Each person on Earth requires at least 20 to 50 liters of clean, safe water a day for drinking, cooking, and simply keeping themselves clean.</li>
                <li>Polluted water isn’t just dirty—it’s deadly. Some 1.8 million people die every year of diarrheal diseases like cholera. </li>
                <li>Tens of millions of others are seriously sickened by a host of water-related ailments—many of which are easily preventable.</li>

                <h3>Stats</h3>
                <p>
                <li>Today, 1 in 9 people lack access to safe water; 1 in 3 people lack access to a toilet. More people have a mobile phone than a toilet. We can change this. Let’s work together to make the power of water available to all.</li>
                <li>844 Million people are living without safe access to water</li>
                <li>340,000 children under five die every year from diarrhoeal diseases.</li></p>

                    <li>Conserve water by turning off the tap when running water is not necessary. This helps prevent water shortages and reduces the amount of contaminated water that needs treatment.</li>
                    <li>Be careful about what you throw down your sink or toilet. Don’t throw paints, oils or other forms of litter down the drain.</li>
                    <li>Use environmentally household products, such as washing powder, household cleaning agents and toiletries.</li>
                    <li>Take great care not to overuse pesticides and fertilisers. This will prevent runoffs of the material into nearby water sources.</li>
                    <li>By having more plants in your garden you are preventing fertiliser, pesticides and contaminated water from running off into nearby water sources.</li>

                    <h3>How Water Pollution affects humans</h3>
                    <li>Infectious diseases can be spread  through contaminated water. Some of these water-borne diseases are Typhoid, Cholera, Paratyphoid Fever, Dysentery, Jaundice, Amoebiasis and Malaria. </li>
                    <li>Chemicals in the water also have negative effects on our health. </li>
                    <li>Pesticides – can damage the nervous system and cause cancer because of the carbonates and organophosphates that they contain. Chlorides can cause reproductive and endocrinal damage.</li>
                    <li>These are just to name a few.</li>
